## Integers addition

Write a function that adds 2 integers.

* Prototype: `def add_integer(a, b=98):`
* `a` and `b` must be integers or floats, otherwise raise a `TypeError` exception with the message `a must be an integer` or `b must be an integer`
* `a` and `b` must be first casted to integers if they are float
* Returns an integer: the addition of `a` and `b`
* You are not allowed to import any module
