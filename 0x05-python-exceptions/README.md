# Tasks

## Safe list printing

Write a function that prints `x` elements of a list.

* Prototype: `def safe_print_list(my_list=[], x=0):`
* `my_list` can contain any type (integer, string, etc.)
* All elements must be printed on the same line followed by a new line.
* `x` represents the number of elements to print
* `x` can be bigger than the length of `my_list`
* Returns the real number of elements printed
* You have to use `try: / except:`
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You are not allowed to use `len()`
